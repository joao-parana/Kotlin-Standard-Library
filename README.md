See details: [https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/kotlin-standard-library-cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/kotlin-standard-library-cookbook)

This is the code bundle for the book, Kotlin Standard Library Cookbook.

> Almost all recipes are present in the Kotlin-Samples directory, however, the separate projects that are created target JS and Android.

Inside the Kotlin-Samples directory there is the content of the main project with pure Kotlin samples.
